#### Encrypter-Decrypter

The idea for this was taken from a [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-encryption-number-1-alternating-split/train/ruby) kata.

##How to use:
There are two methods (encrypt/decrypt), each takes two parameters:
1. String to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Integer n = number of iterations to run of the encryption/decryption

I used this to practice writing RSPEC tests, but you could run from IRB to encrypt/decrypt any text you wanted to evaluate.
